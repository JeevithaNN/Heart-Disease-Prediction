This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to predict the presence of heart disease using clinical patient data such as age, gender, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, ECG results, and other medical parameters. The target variable, heart_disease_present, indicates whether a patient has heart disease (1) or not (0). Through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine, the system identifies patterns associated with heart disease risk. The objective is to assist healthcare professionals in early-stage detection, support clinical decision-making, and help prioritize high-risk patients for timely diagnosis and preventive treatment. This project serves as a decision-support tool and is intended for educational and research purposes only.
